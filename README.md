# Revised Simplex(Linear Programming Optimization)
Full revised simplex(Primal and Dual) containing Tables, Shadowprices,Sensitivity_analysis,all Special conditions checking(Degeneracy,Infeasibility,Non_unique optimal solution,...), each iteration Leaver and Entrant variables.
It solves both Min and Max problem types and all Greater,Lower and Equal constraints.
It solves Primal and Dual problems concurrently.
